# Udacity Feed Reader
The goal of this project is to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

##Description
The tests check the application is doing what it was done for in terms of business logic, event handling and DOM manipulation. Tests:
1. The feeds have a URL defined and the URL is not empty.
2. The feeds have a name defined and the name is not empty.
3. The menu element is hidden by default.
4. The menu displays when is clicked and hides when clicked again.
5. When the feeds are loaded and completed, there is at least a single feed element.
6. When a new feed is loaded, the content actually changes

##Libraries used
- Jasmine 2.1.2

## How it works
- When the user loads the application clicking on https://anbegaral.github.io/feedreader/, the tests are executed
- The Jasmine results page is then visible with the results during a second
- The application is normally loaded
